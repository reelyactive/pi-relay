How do I know it's working?
---------------------------

The program is configured by default to send the data to our [Pareto platform](https://pareto.reelyactive.com).  A three-month trial is included with the [starter kit](http://getpareto.com/starter-kit/)  Log in to view the real-time data from the dashboard.

Prefer to stream the data to a different server?  Simply update the _hostname_ in the pi-relay.js file.
